## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
# Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to analyze trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overall purpose of this challenge was to build on our skills learned in this module, such as the use of filters, pivot tables, pivot charts, formulas, statistics, and visualizations through the use of charts. We  were able to express this knowledge through this weekâ€™s challenge. 

### Purpose
In this challenge, we used a worksheet full of fundraiser information to help Louise figure out when the best time to launch a fundraising campaign would be and what is the appropriate amount of money to attempt to raise. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I began by setting up a pivot table that broke down theater campaigns by when they began and whether the time of year had an impact on whether these campaigns were canceled, failed, or successful. Once this table was created, I used the information to create a line graph to visualize the information generated. This graph can be viewed under the file "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch." 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I also used the COUNTIFS formula to create an informational table that shows what percentage of similar campaigns were successful based on the goals of the fundraiser. Once that table was created, I was able to convert that into a line graph that can be found under "Outcomes_vs_Goals". 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Initially, I had a problem with the COUNTIFS formula, but once I did a little more research on the subject and broke down each part of the formula, it became very easy. Practice makes perfect.

## Results

# What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the information and visualization, we can conclude that the best time to start a fundraising campaign would be in May or June. The number of successful campaigns are much higher during these months. We can also conclude that the worst time would be to launch your campaign in December.

#  What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the information and visualization present, we can conclude that an appropriate fundraising goal to set would be in the 20,000 to 30,000 range. Based on the data, these are the most successful ranges if she wants to raise enough money for her play.

# What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations is that we don't know the reasoning why certain times of the year are better than others. We can make assumptions, but there is no actual data to prove those assumptions.

# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could make tables/graphs showing us what the average donation was for each campaign in each category. This would give us an idea of how successful play/theater campaigns are compared to campaigns in other industries.
